Previous step: Forking the original work and create a specific branch to work on
********************************************************************************
First of all. I (we?) need a repo in my github account: 
https://github.com/josemgdt/rust-lang-book-es

More github steeps
******************
a) Fork original https://github.com/rust-lang/book/ to my repo https://github.com/josemgdt/rust-lang-book-es 
b) Creation of spanish-branch, "es-master" using the github branch selector, from master branch.
c) Making "es-master" the default branch using "Settings->Branches->Default branch"
d) Cloning original book master to local ~/<user>/rust-lang-en (why?): git clone --branch master git@github.com:rust-lang/book.git /home/operarcnc/rust-lang-en

Installation: curl, rustup (rustc, Cargo & folks)
*************************************************
curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server. That tool is not installed on my Debian system, but I have the package in Synaptic.
Install it and........Here we go!

a) Installation via script: $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
b) Test: $ rustc --version
             -> rustc 1.51.0 (2fd73fabe 2021-03-23)  
                          OK. Rust is working.
c) The README.md file states that mdBook is required for build the book:
         $ cargo install mdbook
             -> . . . (a lot of output lines later . . .)
         $ echo $PATH                 # We will have to add Cargo's bin directory to our PATH
                                      # This was already done in the Rust installation
             -> /home/operarcnc/.cargo/bin:/usr/local/bin:  . . . OK
         $ mdbook -V
             -> mdbook v0.4.7
                          OK. mdBook is working.
                         
Links to sections headers (href) do not work: workarround
*********************************************************

In the first translated files, a problem emerges with CI. The links to the sections of the chapters are unusable when the headers of those sections are changed.
CI show a lot of errors.
The issue is the HTML coding of those links. The mdbook crate find translated heads and non-translated references. The collision is inevitable.
Make a clone from the original sources now take a sense 
The grep utility is a great help. We can extract all href from the original .html files (after building them) and planning their translation.

~/rust-lang-en$ mdbook build
$ cd book
$ rm print.html            # huge file. It is not necessary to process it
$ grep -e '><a class="header" href=' *.html > hreflist.txt





 

Progress in ./src. Translated files:
************************************
This list is updated with each new translated file.
* First pass: raw translation; without debugging neither style nor spelling

* Second step: build book in a local clone of my repository. Hunting for bugs on mdBook syntax

* Third step: debugging style/spelling
