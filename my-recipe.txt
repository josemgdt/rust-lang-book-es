Previous step: Forking the original work and create a specific branch to work on
********************************************************************************
First of all. I (we?) need a repo in my github account: 
https://github.com/josemgdt/rust-lang-book-es

More github steeps
******************
a) https://github.com/rust-lang/book/ forked to https://github.com/josemgdt/rust-lang-book-es 
b) Creation of spanish-branch "es-master" using the github branch selector from master branch.
c) Making "es-master" the default branch using "Settings->Branches->Default branch"

I'm not going to use a branch local copy. Instead, I'm going to edit directly on my github repo.

Installation: curl, rustup (rustc, Cargo & folks)
*************************************************
curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server. This tool is not present on my Debian system, but there is an installation package in Synaptic. Here we go!

a) Installation via script. Command: $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
b) Test: $ rustc --version
             -> rustc 1.51.0 (2fd73fabe 2021-03-23)  
                          OK. Rust is working.
c) README.md states that mdBook is required for build the book:
             $ cargo install mdbook
             -> . . . (a lot of output lines later . . .)
             $ echo $PATH                 # We will have to add Cargo's bin directory to our PATH
                                                     # This was already done in the Rust installation
             -> /home/operarcnc/.cargo/bin:/usr/local/bin:  . . . OK
             $ mdbook -V
             -> mdbook v0.4.7
                          OK. mdBook is working.
                         
Progress in ./src. Translated files:

* Second step: build book in a local clone of my repository. Hunting for bugs on mdBook syntax

* Third step: debugging style/spelling
